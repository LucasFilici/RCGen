## Limitations

- Currently, RCGen is tailored for instructors teaching Lifesaving Society courses ranging from Parent & Tot 1 to Preschool 5.

- RCGen runs on Windows and Mac. There may possibly be a website as well. If you would like a Linux build, please ask.

- There are a few instances of the wrong pronouns being used and a number of instances in which run-on sentences are used. The latter issue typically happens when optional feedback is added... This will be fixed after a bit of beta testing is done.
